# Mileage
This is a web based application for monitoring fuel and costs in transport
vehicles (e.g. cars). It's a project written in Django and Python, with a 
little bit of template Bootstrap for mobile use.

Yes, I did spell mileage 'milage' in the beginning of the project, and yes it's
on my to-do list to correct the spelling.

Meanwhile, head over to http://www.dinbenzin.dk and start tracking your fuel!
